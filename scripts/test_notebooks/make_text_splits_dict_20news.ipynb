tell\\natheists that God exists and brings salvation, you may as well not post it,\\nsince it tells us nothing we have not been told before.', '------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Why I know that God exists\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nI *know* from personal experience and prayer that God exists.', 'Response:\\n\\nJust as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship\\nexists, so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not\\nexist.', 'That evidence varies from person to person.', 'Furthermore, without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand, many\\npeople have claimed all kinds of unlikely things -- that they have been\\nabducted by UFOs, visited by the ghost of Elvis, and so on.', '------------------------------\\n\\nSubject:

does not play dice [with the universe]\".', 'This quotation is commonly mentioned to show that Einstein believed in the\\nChristian God.', \"Used this way, it is out of context; it refers to Einstein's\\nrefusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory.\", \"Furthermore,\\nEinstein's religious background was Jewish rather than Christian.\", 'A better quotation showing what Einstein thought about God is the following:\\n\"I believe in Spinoza\\'s God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of\\nwhat exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of\\nhuman beings.\"', 'Einstein was unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in an\\nobjective, orderly reality; a reality which would not be subject to random\\nevents and which would not be dependent upon the observer.', 'He believed that\\nQM was incomplete, and that a better theory would have no need for\\nstatistical interpretations.', 'So far no such better theory has been found,\\nand much evidence suggests that it never will be.', 'A longer quote from Einstein appears in \"Science, Philosophy, and Religion, A\\nSymposium\", published by the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion\\nin Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., New York, 1941.', 'In\\nit he says:\\n\\n  \"The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events\\n   the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side\\n   of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature.', 'For him\\n   neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an\\n   independent cause of natural events.', 'To be sure, the doctrine of a\\n   personal God interfering with natural events could never be\\n   *refuted* [italics his], in the real sense, by science, for this\\n   doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific\\n   knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.', 'But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives\\n   of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal.', 'For a doctrine\\n   which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark,\\n   will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm\\n   to human progress.', 'In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers\\n   of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal\\n   God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past\\n   placed such vast power in the hands of priests.', 'In their labors they\\n   will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable\\n   of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity\\n   itself.', 'This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably\\n   more worthy task...\"\\n\\nEinstein has also said:\\n\\n  \"It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religous convictions,\\n   a lie which is being systematically repeated.', 'I do not believe in a\\n   personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.', 'If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the\\n   unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our\\n   science can reveal it.\"', 'The latter quote is from \"Albert Einstein: The Human Side\", edited by Helen \\nDukas and Banesh Hoffman, and published by Princeton University Press.', 'Also from the same book:\\n\\n  \"I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics\\n   to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind \\n
