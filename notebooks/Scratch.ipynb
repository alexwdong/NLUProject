Please try again later.\\nPublished on Feb 14, 2014\\n\"On the Street Where You Live\" is a song with music by Frederick Loewe and lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner from the 1956 Broadway musical My Fair Lady. It is sung in the musical by the character Freddy Eynsford-Hill, who was portrayed by John Michael King in the original production. In the 1964 film version, it was sung by Bill Shirley, dubbing for actor Jeremy Brett.\\nThe most popular single of the song was recorded by Vic Damone in 1956 for Columbia Records. It reached #4 on the Billboard magazine charts and #6 on Cash Box magazine\\'s chart. It was a #1 hit in the UK in 1958.\\nIn 1955, Damone had only one song on the charts, \"Por Favor,\" which did not make it above #73. However, he did have major roles in two movie musicals, Hit the Deck and Kismet. In early 1956, he moved from Mercury to Columbia Records and had some success on that label with hits like \"On the Street Where You Live\" (from My Fair Lady, his final pop top ten) and \"An Affair to Remember\" (from the movie of the same name). His six original, long-playing albums on Columbia between 1957 and 1961 were That Towering Feeling, Angela Mia, Closer Than a Kiss, This Game of Love, On the Swingin\\' Side and Young and Lively.\\nOh, the towering feeling\\nJust to know somehow you are near\\nI have often walked on this street before\\nBut the pavement always stayed beneath my feet before\\nAll at once am I several stories high\\nKnowing I\\'m on the street where you live\\nAre there lilac trees in the heart of town\\nCan you hear a lark in any other part of town\\nDoes enchantment pour out of every door\\nNo, it\\'s just on the street where you live\\nFor oh, the towering feeling\\nJust to know somehow you are near\\nThe overpowering feeling\\nThat any second you may suddenly appear\\nPeople stop and stare, they don\\'t bother me\\nFor there\\'s nowhere else on earth\\nThat I would rather be\\nLet the time go by, I won\\'t care if I\\nCan be here on the street where you live\\nSound recording administered by SME (thanks for allowing this to remain)\\n\"The AUDIO content does not belong to me.
