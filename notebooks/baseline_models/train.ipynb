    "In this notebook we explore different approach to overcome one of the main limitation of BERT (which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), the ability to process long document. In fact BERT can only be applied on text that have less than 512 token after tokenization with the Bert Tokenizer.\n",

    "1. Read the data and do some basic preprocessing\n",
    "2. Break the documents into smaller segments with a number of tokens that can be handled by BERT\n",
    "3. Fine-tune BERT on those segments using a classification head\n",

    "The preprocessing step goes as follows:\n",
    "1. Remove all documents with fewer than 250 tokens. We want to concentrate only on long texts\n",
    "2. Consolidate the classes by combining those that are similar. (e.g.: \"Credit card\" or \"prepaid card\" complaints) :\n",

    " * ‘Credit card‘ to ‘Credit card or prepaid card‘.\n",
    " * ‘Payday loan‘ to ‘Payday loan, title loan or personal loan‘1\n",
    " * ‘Virtual currency‘ to ‘Money transfer, virtual currency or money servic\n",
    "3. Remove all non-word characters\n",
    "4. Encode the labels\n",
    "5. Split the dataset in train set (80%) and validation set (20%).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Segmentation and tokenization:\n",
    "First, each complaint is split into 200-token chunk with an overlap of 50 between each of them. This means that the last 50 tokens of a segment are the first 50 of the next segment.  \n",
    "Then, each segment is tokenized using BERT's tokenizer. This is needed for two main reasons:\n",
    "1. BERT's vocabulary is not made of just English words, but also subwords and single characters\n",
    "2. BERT does not take raw string as inputs. It needs:\n",
    "    - token ids: those values allow BERT to retrieve the tensor representation of a token\n",
    "    - input mask: a tensor of 0s and 1s that shows whether a token should be ignored (0) or not (1) by BERT\n",
    "    - segment ids: those are used to tell BERT what tokens form the first sentence and the second sentence (in the next sentence prediction task)  \n",
    "    \n",
    "The parameter `MAX_SEQ_LENGTH` ensures that any tokenized sentence longer that that number (200 in this case) will be truncated.  \n",
    "Each returned segment is given the same class as the document containing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch offers the `Dataset` and `DataLoader` classes that make it easier to group the data reading and preparation operations while decreasing the memory usage in case the dataset is large.  \n",
    "We implemented the above steps in the `Custom_Dataset_Class.py` file. Our dataset class `ConsumerComplaintsDataset1` has a constructor (`__init__`) taking the necessary parameters to load the .csv file, segment the documents, and then tokenize them. It also preprocesses the data as explained in the preprocessing section.    \n",
    "The two other important methods are the following:\n",
    "- `__len__` returns the number of documents\n",
    "- `__getitem__` is the method where most of the work is done. It takes a tensor of idx values and returns the tokenized data:\n",

    "- **all**: overflowing tokens from a document are used to create new 200 token chunk with 50 tokens overlap between them\n",
    "- **head**: overflowing tokens are truncated. Only the first 200 tokens are used.\n",
    "- **tail**: only the last 200 tokens are kept."
